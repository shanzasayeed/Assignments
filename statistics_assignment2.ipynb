    "Q1. What are the three measures of central tendency?\n",
    "The three measures of central tendency are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean\n",
    "Median\n",
    "Mode\n",
    "Q2. Difference between Mean, Median, and Mode:\n",
    "Mean: The mean is the average value of a dataset calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of values. It is sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "Median: The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is arranged in ascending or descending order. It is not affected by extreme values (outliers).\n",
    "Mode: The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. It can be used for both qualitative and quantitative data.\n",
    "These measures are used to measure the central tendency of a dataset by providing information about where the center or typical value lies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Measures of Central Tendency for Height Data:\n",
    "Let's calculate the mean, median, and mode for the given height data:\n",
    "[178, 177, 176, 177, 178.2, 178, 175, 179, 180, 175, 178.9, 176.2, 177, 172.5, 178, 176.5]\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: Sum of all heights / Number of heights\n",
    "Median: Middle value when heights are sorted\n",
    "Mode: Most frequent height\n",
    "Q4. Standard Deviation Calculation:\n",
    "Standard deviation measures the spread or dispersion of data points in a dataset. Let's calculate the standard deviation for the given data:\n",
    "[178, 177, 176, 177, 178.2, 178, 175, 179, 180, 175, 178.9, 176.2, 177, 172.5, 178, 176.5]\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Measures of Dispersion (Range, Variance, Standard Deviation):\n",
    "Measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation quantify the spread or variability of data points in a dataset. Range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values, variance measures the average squared deviation from the mean, and standard deviation is the square root of variance, providing a measure of average deviation from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Venn Diagram:\n",
    "A Venn diagram is a graphical representation used to show the relationships between sets. It consists of overlapping circles or other shapes representing different sets, with areas of overlap indicating common elements."

    "### Q7. Set Operations for A and B:\n",
    "Given sets: A = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} and B = {0, 2, 6, 8, 10}\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) **A - B (Set Difference):** Elements in A that are not in B\n",
    "\\[ A - B = \\{3, 4, 5, 7\\} \\]\n",

    "\n",
    "### Q8. Skewness in Data:\n",
    "Skewness in data refers to the asymmetry of the data distribution. A dataset can be:\n",
    "- **Symmetric:** No skewness, the distribution is balanced around the mean.\n",
    "- **Right Skewed (Positive Skewness):** The tail of the distribution extends to the right, and the mean > median.\n",
    "- **Left Skewed (Negative Skewness):** The tail of the distribution extends to the left, and the mean < median.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q9. Position of Median in Right Skewed Data:\n",
    "In right-skewed data, the tail extends to the right, and the mean is greater than the median. So, the position of the median with respect to the mean is:\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Mean} > \\text{Median} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q10. Covariance vs. Correlation:\n",
    "- **Covariance:** Covariance measures the degree to which two variables change together. A positive covariance indicates a direct relationship, while a negative covariance indicates an inverse relationship. However, it does not provide the strength of the relationship.\n",
    "- **Correlation:** Correlation is a standardized measure that quantifies the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, and 0 indicates no linear correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These measures are used in statistical analysis to understand relationships between variables and assess their strength and direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q11. Formula for Sample Mean:\n",
    "The formula for calculating the sample mean (average) is:\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Mean} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i}{n} \\]\n",
    "where \\( X_i \\) are the individual data points and \\( n \\) is the number of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example calculation:\n",
    "For a dataset {10, 15, 20, 25, 30}, the mean is:\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Mean} = \\frac{10 + 15 + 20 + 25 + 30}{5} = \\frac{100}{5} = 20 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q12. Relationship in Normal Distribution:\n",
    "In a normal distribution:\n",
    "- The mean, median, and mode are all equal.\n",
    "- The distribution is symmetric around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q13. Difference between Covariance and Correlation:\n",
    "- Covariance measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables but does not provide the scale of the relationship.\n",
    "- Correlation is a standardized measure that not only quantifies the strength and direction but also provides the scale of the linear relationship between two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q14. Outliers' Impact on Measures:\n",
    "- Outliers can significantly affect the mean, pulling it towards extreme values.\n",
    "- Outliers have less impact on the median, as it is not affected by extreme values.\n",
    "- Outliers can increase the variability and influence the range, variance, and standard deviation.\n",
